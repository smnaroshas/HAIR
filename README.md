# HAIR
HAIR Soluttions:
The main goal is to design and implement Hybrid Augmented Intelligent Robotics (HAIR) devices and related system software using hybrid augmented intelliegnce (HAI). The prinicpal behind HAI is the syngery of human on the way back and human in the loop. Data augmentation is done using 3D information fusion techniques introduced and its proven ability based on so far built systems. The ultimate goal is to build Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and its related system software using cloud computing. First effort towards this goal was succesfully deployed by providing services using the Artificial Intelligence-enabled School ware (AISware) for all national schools.
